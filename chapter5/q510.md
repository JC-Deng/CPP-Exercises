unique_ptr is light-weight smart pointer that ensures sole ownership of one resourse.
shared_ptr however allows multiple pointers to share ownership of a resourse, and
thus it have to track the count of ownership and release the resourse once all the
pointers go out of scope. Unless specifically needed, unique_ptr should be used to
make a more streamlined ownership.
