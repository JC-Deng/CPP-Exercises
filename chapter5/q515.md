## (a)
A std::vector which is sorted after initialized is the best choice.  
i. Since it's sorted, binary search can be used. Therefore, complexity of locating an element will be O(log N).  
ii. std::vector handles built-in type well.  
iii. std::vector is the most memory saving STL container.  
iv. Due to iii., large number of elements is supported well.  
v. Sorting will cost, but it's done only once so it's OK.

## (b)
std::set will be the best choice. Locating an element will be O(log N). Insertion and deletion will be quick. Memory usage is relatively large though, so in iii. it performs worse than std::vector.

## (c)
std::list is best for the case. Adding and removing elements from arbitrary positions are fast, and locating the first and last elements are also efficient.
