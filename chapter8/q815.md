## Stable Reference to Element
std::vector does not have stable reference to elements, because it will automatically reallocate space when the size of the vector grows. If a reference to an element of vector try to write after memory modification, it might write into random memory space and become very dangerous.

std::list in comparison can provide a steady reference to an element in the container. Because the container keeps each element in separate locations and doesn't modify its location when the number of element grows.

## Stable Iterator
Similar to stable reference, for array-structured containers it is not possible to maintain a stable iterator after deletion. However for linked-list and tree structured containers, deleting an element won't affect the iterator other than the deleted element itself. Therefore, if we use erase(iter++) in iterators of the two types of containers, we can consider them stable.
