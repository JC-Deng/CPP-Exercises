## Time/Space complexity
```C++
unsigned long long factorial_1(unsigned int n)
{
  unsigned long long result = 1;
  for (auto i = n; i > 1; --i) {
    result *= i;
  }
  return result;
}
```
The time complexity of the above code is O(N).  
The space complexity of the above code is O(1).

```C++
unsigned long long factorial_2(unsigned int n)
{
  if (n >= 2) {
    return n*factorial_2(n - 1);
  } else {
    return 1;
  }
}
```
The time complexity of the above code is O(N)  
The time complexity of the above code is O(N)

## Comparison
We can see that usually recursive algorithm will have at least the space complexity of O(N), and in the above case the time complexity is the same so it's better to choose a linear approach. Plus recursive functions have a deep call stack which will make it hard to debug, therefore I think it's usually better to avoid it.
