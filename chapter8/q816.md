## Explaination
Worst-case complexity: In the worst possible condition, the time-complexity of one algorithm.

Amortized complexity: Weigh each possible condition by its frequency and sum up a weighted time-complexity of one algorithm.

## Specific Situation
If one application have strict upper limitation to return a result, the worse-case complexity must be considered. For example, in a bank application that one search must be completed within a certain threshold.

If the load is evenly distributed and the server processes a constant inflow of tasks with no require for response time, amortized complexity will become a good evaluation for such workload.
