For a copy constructor, when a pass by value happens it will call the copy constructor to create a temporary object. If the copy constructor is defined in a pass by value fashion, it will result in an endless loop of calling itself.

For a move constructor, simliar reason applies because the purpose of using a move constructor is to avoid costly copy operation. A copy during creation of a temporary object will defeat the purpose of the move constructor.
